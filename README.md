# qmacro's dotfiles

## Installation

This repository contains configuration and customisation settings for DJ Adams's workspace, following the [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) philosophy and practice. The structure and approach is based on [Mathias Bynens's dotfiles repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

## Requirements

The dotfiles here have been developed on macOS, which is what you'll need to use them. They will most likely work on Linux too.

## Download and installation

To install, clone this repository. I suggest cloning it to `.dotfiles` in your home directory, which is where I keep mine. Once you've done this, run the bootstrap script, which you should also run whenever you wish to bring in any updates.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/devenv-dotfiles-qmacro ~/.dotfiles \
&& cd ~/.dotfiles \
&& source ./bootstrap.sh
```
