# qmacro's dotfiles

## Installation

This repository contains configuration and customisation settings for DJ Adams's workspace, following the [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) philosophy and practice.

## Requirements

The dotfiles here have been developed on macOS, which is what you'll need to use them. They will most likely work on Linux too.

## Download and installation

To install, clone this repository. I suggest cloning it to your home directory, which is where I keep mine. Be careful not to clobber anything you already have there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/devenv-dotfiles-qmacro ~/
```
